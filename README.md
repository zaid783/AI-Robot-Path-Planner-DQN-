# AI-Robot-Path-Planner-DQN-
🤖 AI Robot Path Planner using Deep Q-Network (DQN)
An intelligent grid-based robot navigation system powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning
🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to navigate through a grid world environment to reach a target destination. The agent uses reinforcement learning to discover optimal paths while avoiding inefficient routes.
✨ Key Features

🧠 Deep Q-Learning Algorithm - Neural network-based decision making
🎮 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard - Real-time training visualization
📊 Performance Tracking - Episode rewards and training progress charts
🗺️ Visual Path Display - Grid-based route visualization with emojis
⚙️ Configurable Parameters - Adjustable grid size and training episodes
🚀 Real-time Simulation - Watch the trained agent navigate in real-time

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Environment: Custom GridWorld with start (🚩) and goal (🏁) positions
Agent: DQN with experience replay and ε-greedy exploration
Neural Network: 2-layer fully connected network (24-24-4 neurons)
Reward System: +100 for goal reaching, -1 for each step (efficiency optimization)
Training: Batch learning with memory buffer (2000 experiences)
